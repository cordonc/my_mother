        <p>Dear Paul,</p>
        
        <p>We all miss you very much. </p>
        
        <p>You wonder why I didn’t answer your question on the day you were leaving. The truth was that I was feeling quite sorry that day, and I didn’t know how ot answer it directly. Well, now I can tell you.</p> 
        
        <p>(1) Though Ting is married off to a place far away, I don’t feel worried at all because she has a good husband to take care of her. </p>
        
        <p>(2) I feel a little sorry, indeed, but I am quite happy I know both of you love each other deeply. And that’s the basis of building a good family. What I concern most is whether you can live harmoniously instead of the place where Ting gets married. Suppose Ting is married in Taiwan, and her spouse doesn’t treat her well. Ting is the most important, not the place Ting is married to. <p>
        
        <p>Congratulations in your marriage. By the way, some students want to say “Hello” to you. They all miss you, especially May and Cindy. </p>
        
       <p> With love </p>
        <p>(Chinese Characters)
